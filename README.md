# Pong League


### Description
Pong League is an iOS app that serves as a record keeping, social platform to record games you play with your friends. You will be able to set up an account and have your own 'table'. You can manage the house rules for your table and customize everything about your style of pong you play with your friends. It will be able to store your statistics and records against your friends. Future functionality will be included that allow users to host leagues and make custom brackets based on amount of participants.

### Background
During these lockdown times, the way that my roommates and I have been passing the time is by playing countless games of water pong. It's simple to setup, only takes about 10 minutes a game, and gives you a semblance of physical activity in your day. If you've played this game before you'll know that depending on who's house you're playing at, you may be playing a significantly different flavor of the game you are used to. I decided to create this app to be able to track the differences and allow users to have an easy convenient place for guests to check out how they like to play the game, thus eliminating the need for a white board/poster to hold all the house rules which many times does not fit that medium anyways.
